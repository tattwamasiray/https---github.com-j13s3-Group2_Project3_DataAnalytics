# Travelling Companions, Part 3

This is the third and final part of a three-part mini-project.

In this final part, you will take the DataFrame you created and, using Matplotlib, chart a comparison of three different countries for one type of travelling companion between 2016 and 2018.

## Instructions

* Check the comments in each cell of this [Jupyter Notebook file](Unsolved/travelling_companions.ipynb) for activity instructions.

* Your output should align with the following figure, depending on the user’s input variable:
