# Average Rainfall

In this activity, you will create a bar chart that shows the average rainfall in different cities by importing data from a CSV file.

## Instructions

* Review the [raw data](Resources/avg_rain_cities.csv) in the `Resources` folder. This dataset contains the average rainfall in major cities in any given year.

* Using the [starter file](Unsolved/avg_cities_rain.ipynb), generate a plot that shows the average rainfall per city, as per the following image:

## Hint

* Think critically about the different plots we discussed today. Ask yourself which type of plot summarises the data most effectively.

* Be sure to add a title, axis labels, and any other aesthetic elements that may help make the visualisation more effective.
