# Coaster Speed

In this activity, you will create a line chart that graphs the speed of a roller coaster over time. You will then style the chart and add aesthetics to it.

## Instructions

* Create a visualisation with two line plots by using the following data:

  * `Danger Drop: [15, 13, 145, 137, 129, 113, 113, 105, 89, 97, 113, 105, 81]`

  * `RailGun: [121, 113, 97, 105, 97, 73, 89, 81, 64, 64, 56, 56, 48]`

* Note that both coasters are 120 seconds long, and the speed was measured every 10 seconds.

* Apply styling and labels that match the image provided:

  * Title: Coaster Speed Over Time.

  * x-axis label: Coaster Runtime.

  * y-axis label: Speed (km/hr).

  * Red line for Danger Drop, blue line for RailGun.

  * Include a grid on the chart.
