# Melbourne Weather

In this activity, you will visualise the differences between temperatures recorded in degrees Celsius and those recorded in degrees Fahrenheit.

## Instructions

* Using the following data, plot the monthly averages for the temperature at Melbourne Airport during 2021 in both degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit:

  * Average temperature per month in Celsius: 26.1, 25.3, 22.5, 20.6, 17.3, 14.5, 13.5, 15.8, 17.9, 19.2, 20.3, 24.7.

* Assign to the x-axis a range of numerical values representing each month of the year.

* Plot the degrees Celsius points.

* Use a list comprehension to convert the temperatures to degrees Fahrenheit.

  * The formula for conversion is: F = C * 9/5 + 32. In this formula, C is degrees Celsius, and F is degrees Fahrenheit.

* Plot the degrees Fahrenheit points.

* Create a third plot with both the degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit points.

## Hint

* Check the [Matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/index.html) for more information about the PyPlot library.

* Also check the [NumPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/) for more information about the NumPy library.
