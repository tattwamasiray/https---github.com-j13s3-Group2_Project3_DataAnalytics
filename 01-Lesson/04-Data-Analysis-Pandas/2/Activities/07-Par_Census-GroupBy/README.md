# Exploring Census Data

In this activity, you will use data from the 2016 Australian Census and create DataFrames with calculated totals and averages for each state.

## Instructions

1. Read in the [2016_rental_by_LGA.csv](Unsolved/Resources/2016_rental_by_LGA.csv) CSV file with Pandas.

2. Create a `GroupBy` object, where the data is grouped by state.

3. Create two new DataFrames from the `GroupBy` object: one with the total (sum) of each column and one with the average (mean) of each column.

4. Add a column to the totals DataFrame that is the sum of all the other columns.

5. Export the resulting tables to CSVs.
