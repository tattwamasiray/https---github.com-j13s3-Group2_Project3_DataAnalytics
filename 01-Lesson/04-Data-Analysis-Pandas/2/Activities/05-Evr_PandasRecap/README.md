# Pandas Recap and Data Types

In this activity, we will recap what we have learned about Pandas up to this point while helping Main Roads WA identify road stops that need accessibility improvements.

## Instructions

* Open `PandasRecap.ipynb` from the `Unsolved` folder into your Jupyter notebook.

* Go through the cells, and follow the instructions in the comments.

## Hints

* A list of a DataFrame's data types can be checked by accessing its `dtypes` property.

* To change a non-numeric column to a numeric column, use the `df.astype(<datatype>)` method and pass in the desired data type as the parameter.
