# GDP Merging

In this activity, you will merge two datasets regarding GDP and government spending from 2017, do a calculation, and then sort the values.

## Instructions

* Read in both of the CSV files, and print out their DataFrames.

* Perform an inner merge that combines both DataFrames on the "Country Name" columns.

* Drop NA values from the domestic health expenditure column.

* Create a DataFrame that filters the data only on countries with a GDP greater than USD 10 billion.

* Add a new column that calculates the percentage of GDP spent on domestic health.

* Sort the data by health expenditure as a percentage of GDP, highest to lowest, to find the country that spends the highest percentage of their GDP on domestic health.

* Print out the data for the country that spends the highest percentage of their GDP on domestic health.

* Bonus: Print out the data for the country that spends the lowest percentage of their GDP on domestic health with one line of code.
