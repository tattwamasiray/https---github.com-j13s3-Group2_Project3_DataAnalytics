# House of Pies

In this activity, you will build an order form that displays a list of pies and then prompts the user to make a selection. The form will continue to prompt for selections until the user decides to end the process.

## Instructions

* Create an order form that displays a list of pies to the user in the following way:

```text
Welcome to the House of Pies! Here are our pies:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Aussie Beef, (2) Steak and Kidney, (3) Chicken, (4) Shepherd’s, (5) Spinach and Feta, (6) Curry, (7) Lamb and Rosemary, (8) Steak and Mushroom, (9) Apple, (10) Lemon Meringue
```

* Then, prompt the user to enter the number for the pie they would like to order.

* Immediately follow up their order with `Great! We'll have that <PIE NAME> right out for you`, and then ask if they would like to make another order. If so, repeat the process.

* Once the user is done purchasing pies, print the total number of pies ordered.

## Bonus

* Modify the application so that at the conclusion of the transaction, the user's purchases are listed out, with the total pie count broken down by each pie. For example:

```text
You purchased:
0 Aussie Beef
0 Steak and Kidney
0 Chicken
2 Shepherd's
0 Spinach and Feta
0 Curry
0 Lamb and Rosemary
0 Steak and Mushroom
0 Apple
1 Lemon Meringue
```
