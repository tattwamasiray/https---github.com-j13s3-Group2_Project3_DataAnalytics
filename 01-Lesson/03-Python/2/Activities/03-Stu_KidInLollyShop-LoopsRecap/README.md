# Kid in a Lolly Shop

In this activity, you will create the code that a lolly shop will use in their state-of-the-art lolly vending machine.

## Instructions

* Create a loop that prints all of the lollies in the store to the terminal, with their indexes stored in brackets beside them.

  * For example: `"[0] Fantales"`

* Create a second loop that runs for a set number of times determined by the variable `allowance`.

  * For example: If `allowance` is equal to 5, the loop should run 5 times.

  * Each time this second loop runs, take in a user's input, preferably a number, and then add the candy with the matching index to the variable `lolly_cart`.

  * For example: If the user enters "0" as their input, "Fantales" should be added into the `lolly_cart` list.

* Use another loop to print all of the selected lollies to the terminal.

## Bonus

Create a version of the code that allows a user to select as many lollies as they want until they say they do not want any more.
