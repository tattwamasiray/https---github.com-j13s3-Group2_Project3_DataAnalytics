# Time Off Functions

In this activity, you will create a function that searches a list of employees and determines how much PTO, sick time, and voting time they have used.

## Instructions

* Analyse the code and CSV provided, looking specifically for what needs to still be added to the application.

* Using the starter code provided, create a function called `print_percentages` which takes in a parameter called `employee_data` and does the following:

  * Uses the data stored within `employee_data` to calculate the usage rates for each type of time off.

  * Prints out the time off usage rates for each type of time off.

Note: Some employees do not have sick leave, so make sure to check for that.

## Bonus

* Still within the `print_percentages()` function, calculate the overall time off usage rate, and create a conditional that checks an employee's overall time off usage rate and prints either "Adequate Time Off" to the screen if the number was greater than 50 or "Encourage employee to take time off" if the number was less than 50.
